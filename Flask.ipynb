    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, making it a popular choice for developing web applications, APIs, and other web services. Flask provides the tools and libraries necessary to build web applications, but it does not enforce any specific architecture or require the use of particular libraries or tools. This flexibility allows developers to choose the components and design patterns that best fit their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some advantages of Flask framework include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask is minimalistic and does not have any dependencies on external libraries, making it lightweight and easy to set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Flask gives developers the freedom to choose the tools and libraries they want to use, allowing for greater flexibility in designing and building web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to learn: Flask has a simple and intuitive API, making it easy for developers to get started with building web applications, especially for those familiar with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensible: Flask provides a modular architecture that allows developers to easily extend its functionality by adding plugins and extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in development server: Flask comes with a built-in development server, making it easy to test and debug applications during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well-documented: Flask has extensive documentation and a large community of users and contributors, making it easy to find help and resources when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: While Flask is lightweight, it is also scalable and can be used to build small, simple applications as well as larger, more complex ones.\n",

    "Q3. What is app routing in Flask ? Why we use app routes ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flask , an app route refers to the url pattern associated with a specific view function . App routing in flask is the process of mapping Urls (uniform resource functions) , within a Falsk applicaton .\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user makes a request ta a specific Url in a flask application , Flask's routing system determines which view function should handle that request based on the defined url patterns (app routes ) in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use app routes in Flask for several reasons :\n",
    "\n",
    "URL Dispatching: App routes allow us to define the URL patterns that should be handled by different parts of our application. This enables Flask to dispatch incoming requests to the appropriate view function based on the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularization: By defining app routes, we can modularize our Flask application into different sections or components, with each section handling specific sets of URLs. This helps in organizing code and maintaining a clean project structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful APIs: For building RESTful APIs, app routes are crucial as they allow us to define endpoints for various resources and specify the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that should be supported by each endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic URL Generation: Flask's routing system supports dynamic URL generation, allowing us to define app routes with placeholders for variable parts of the URL. This is useful for creating dynamic web pages or handling requests with variable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "URL Building: Flask provides functions for generating URLs based on the app routes defined in the application. This makes it easy to generate links dynamically within templates or view functions, ensuring consistency and avoiding hardcoding of URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, app routes are essential in Flask for defining the structure and behavior of web applications, facilitating URL routing, and enabling the handling of incoming requests efficiently.\n",
