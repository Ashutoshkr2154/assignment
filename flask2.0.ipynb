    "Q1. Explain GET and POST methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flask , like in many web frameworks , the GET and POST methods are used to handle different types of HTTP requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. GET Method :\n",
    "- The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource. \n",
    "- In Flask , routes can handle GET requests  using the '@app.route ' decorator . By Default , routes in Flask handle GET requests.\n",
    "- When a user accesses a URL through a web browser , the browser sends a GET requests resource (eg. a webpage , an image or data ).\n",
    "- GET requests are typically used for fetching data , and they are considered safe and idempotent , meaning they should not modify server state or have any side effects .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post Method :\n",
    "- The post method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource .\n",
    "- In Flask , to handle POST requests, you typically use the 'methods ' parameter in the '@app.route' decorator , specifying 'methods = ['POST']'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- when a user submits a form or performs an action that requires sending data to the server (eg ., submitting a login form or adding information to a database ), the browser sends a POST request to the server , containing the data to be processed .\n",
    "- POST request are often used for actions that modify server state , such as creating , updating  , or deleting resources . They are not indempotent, meaning multiple identical requests may have different effects on the server ."

    "Q2. Why is request used in Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flask  the 'request' object is used to access incoming request data sent by a client to the server . It allows you to interact with various aspects of the HTTP requests , such as parameters , from data , headers , cookies and files uploading via forms .The 'request' object provides a convenient interface to extract and manipulate this data within your Flask routes or views.\n",
    "\n",
    "here are some common use cases for the 'request' objects in Flask:\n",
    "1. Accessing Form Data : - When a user submits a form , the data entered into the form fields is sent to the server . The 'request.form ' attribute allows you to access this from data  as a dictionary-like object , where the keys are the names of the form fields .\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Accessing Query Parameters : Query parameters are part of the URL and are used to send additional infornmation to the server . The 'requests.args' attribute provides access to the query parameters as a  dictionary- like object .\n",
    "3. Accessing Request Headers : HTTP headers contain metadata about the request , such as the user agent , content type , and accepted languages . The 'request.headers ' attribute allows you to access these headers as a dictionary like object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Accessing Request Methods and urls : The 'request.method ' attribute returns the HTTP requests methods (eg. GET , POST , PUT , DELETE ) while the 'request.url' attribute returns the full URL of the request."

    "1. Redirect After Form Submission : \n",
    "After a form is submitted , it's common to redirect the user to another page to display a success message or to a different route for further processing . By using ' redirect()' you can send the user to a new URl after processing the form data .\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handling Authentication and Authorization: \n",
    "When a user tries to access a protected resource without proper authentication or authorization , we might want to redirect them to a login page or an access denied page . 'redirect()' allows us to send to the user to the appropriate URL based on their authentication status .\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cleaner URls: \n",
    "Sometimes , we may want to present user with cleaner or more user friendly URLs. we can use 'redirect()' to internally map these cleaner URLs .we can use 'redirect()' to automatically redirect requests from the old URLs to the new ones .This helps to maintain compatibility  with existing bookmarks and external links ."
